Software dependencies for this project include a VPN associated with that of Boise State. Other dependencies of the project include the format of the raw data that is to be plotted on the stress strain curve. The data must have the exact same format as the original raw data. That is, the stress must be in the forth column and the strain must be in the ninth  column. Furthermore, a machine with MobaXTerm and VIM is required. On the machine, matplotlib.pyplot, numpy, and sys must be imported.
How to get it: For a user to get access to the code that will plot the stress strain curve, they would need to copy the code from github using either gitclone or by clicking the download button to copy the data to their machine. Essentially, they would need to copy the entire repository.

How to run it: For a user to run the code that will generate the graph, the code " python plot.py ./raw-data [INSERT DATA HERE]" must be ran in the command line terminal while under the p1-start directory.

An example for how to run the code, would be to download the repository that contains the code and then to execute the script written above in the command line terminal, for different sets of data. The user should expect a PDF file of the curve to appear, along with the Young's Modulus value. On the PDF there will be two lines graphed: the actual data and the linear regression (the slope of which determines the Young's Modulus). Several different errors may appear when trying to execute the code. If you are not in the right directory, an error will be given saying the data does not exist or can't be found. Another error may be given if there is text or characters within the data that python is trying to interpret as numbers, skip rows and delimiters should be used to solve this. Lastly, several different data sets should be made for data files with multiple specimans.

Things I have learned throughout this project is how to navigate the command line terminal using bash and python. It has been really useful to know how to take sets of data, such as the tungsten and aluminum, and use methods of copying, pasting, and deleting to create more usable sets of data. I have also had fun learning how to use the VIM software, and how code written in VIM can be executed in the command line terminal, which was how the graphs were done. I have also learned several different shortcuts within VIM, such as ":e plot.py" and ":bn" to navigate and open multiple files at once.
