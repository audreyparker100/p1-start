Software dependencies for this project include a VPN associated with that of Boise State. Other dependencies of the project include the format of the raw data that is to be plotted on the stress strain curve. The data must have the exact same format as the original raw data. That is, the stress must be in the forth column and the strain must be in the ninth  column.

Things I have learned throughout this project is how to navigate the command line terminal using bash and python. It has been really useful to know how to take sets of data, such as the tungsten and aluminum and use methods of copying, pasting, and deleting to create more usable sets of data. I haave also had fun learning how to use the VIM software, and how code written in VIM can be executed in the command line terminal, which was how the graphs were done.
